Philips hue Developer API documentation
=======================================

The hue documentation itself can be read on http://developers.meethue.com/.
You only need this repository if you want to make changes to it.

To work on the documentation locally you need to install Jekyll and Pygments:

    sudo gem install jekyll

    sudo easy_install Pygments

See https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install for full documentation.

Once jekyll is installed you can run it by typing

    jekyll --server

You will then have a server running on [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
