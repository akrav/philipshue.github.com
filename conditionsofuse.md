You are free to develop the application you would like with the hue system. With the following restrictions:
* We ask you not to develop or distribute other bridges or devices which make use of or interpret the hue api.
* We additionally ask you not to distribute the documentation shown on [developers.meethue.com](http://developers.meethue.com/) through any other means than the site itself.
* The "devicetype" used when creating whitelist entries must contain the name of your application.
* Make sure it's clear that the creation is your own. So do not use any hue or Philips branding.
* It is obvious that we want you and others to enjoy hue. So please assure that your application is not offensive and that its use is legal.
