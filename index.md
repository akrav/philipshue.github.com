### See what you can do
Your feedback following our hue launch was clear. You want to use light as you want it. Here we provide you some material to do so. The hue bridge has a powerful [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services) interface, which behaves like a simple web service. Use it as your tool. We hope this will help you to truly use light as you want it, by making new apps, websites and digital installations; integrating hue into something else or just playing around.

### Getting started
We've started off by releasing the core parts of our bridge interface along with some easy to follow examples for how to use them. This should be enough to get you up and running controlling lights from your applications.

* Easy step by step guide to [get you started](/gettingstarted.html)
* See what you can do with [the hue system](/coreconcepts.html)
* Questions? Ideas? Post them on our [developer forum](http://www.everyhue.com/?page_id=38)

### Free to publish
We don’t want to profit from your work; what you produce you own and are free to give away or sell. What you develop is your own responsibility and Philips cannot be held liable for any resulting damages or losses. Also it is your own responsibility if you decide to commercialize your development. Philips cannot support you in that process. The interface may evolve over time but we will do our best to keep backwards compatibility wherever possible and be sure to inform you upfront before rolling out any updates. 

All we ask is you properly [register your apps in the whitelist](/4_configurationapi.html#41_create_user) and make sure it’s clear that it’s your creation. You are not allowed to use hue or Philips branding. Above all, you’re free to experiment and have fun with it. 

### More to come
There will be more documentation for the other features over time. The iOS SDK libraries are currently in open beta and available [here](TODO: ADD LINK HERE) which make linking hue to your apps a breeze. The Android SDK and other tools will available later this year. 

There will be additional tiers to the developer program added over time where you can have access to the portal APIs, hue endorsement/promotion and more.

Feel free to make a post on the [developer forum](http://www.everyhue.com/?page_id=38) to share what you are doing, your experiences or for more information/support.
